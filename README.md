!["LSTMs for Text Generation"](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*n-IgHZM5baBUjq0T7RYDBw.gif)

Text Generation using LSTM has been done since quite a time now! In this project, I am trying my hands on using LSTMs to generate product descriptions from data scrapped from multiple websites. 
Many e-commerce companies need to describe their products manually and there are millions of products out there. If we try to build a model which can generate logical product descriptions, we can save a lot time and money and put our work-force at some better work.
In this project, I am trying to get a hands on exprerience on web-scraping, text data processing, exploratory data analysis and builing LSTM Networks for text generation.

Data Collection:
The data is collected from sevral e-commerce websites and is strictly used for academic purposes only.
